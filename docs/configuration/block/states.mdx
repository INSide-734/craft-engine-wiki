## Introduction

In Minecraft's block system, each block has one or more block states. For example, wood has a facing direction, and leaves have different distances. These states determine how the block behaves and appears in the game.

## Single-State Block

Most blocks only require a single state to function properly. The example below shows how to configure a single-state block.

```yaml
# ËåÉ‰æã1Ôºö‰ΩøÁî®auto-stateËá™Âä®ÂàÜÈÖç‰∏Ä‰∏™ÂèØÁî®ÁöÑnote_blockÁöÑÂ§ñËßÇ
blocks:
  default:chinese_lantern:
    state:
      auto-state: note_block
      model:
        path: "minecraft:block/custom/chinese_lantern"
        generation:
          parent: "minecraft:block/cube_column"
          textures:
            "end": "minecraft:block/custom/chinese_lantern_top"
            "side": "minecraft:block/custom/chinese_lantern"

# ËåÉ‰æã2Ôºö‰ΩøÁî®stateÊåáÂÆö‰∏Ä‰∏™ÊñπÂùóÁä∂ÊÄÅ
blocks:
  default:chinese_lantern:
    state:
      state: note_block
      model:
        path: "minecraft:block/custom/chinese_lantern"
        generation:
          parent: "minecraft:block/cube_column"
          textures:
            "end": "minecraft:block/custom/chinese_lantern_top"
            "side": "minecraft:block/custom/chinese_lantern"
```


### Visual State



### Model

```yaml
blocks:
  default:chinese_lantern:
    state:
      model:
        path: "minecraft:block/custom/chinese_lantern"
        generation:
          parent: "minecraft:block/cube_column"
          textures:
            "end": "minecraft:block/custom/chinese_lantern_top"
            "side": "minecraft:block/custom/chinese_lantern"
```

The `model` determines which 3D model will replace the released vanilla block state. In addition to standard block models, CraftEngine allows further configuration of randomized models and model rotation.

:::caution

If you are unsure how to configure properties like `path` and `generation`, you should complete [Tutorial](../../getting_start.mdx) firstly.

:::

#### Weighted Models

To achieve randomized models, just provide model paths in a list format:

```yaml
state:
  models: # model(s)
    - path: "minecraft:block/custom/fairy_flower_1"
      weight: 8
    - path: "minecraft:block/custom/fairy_flower_2"
      weight: 5
    - path: "minecraft:block/custom/fairy_flower_3"
      weight: 2
```

> weight: Sets the probability of the model for being used in the game, defaults to 1 (=100%). If more than one model is used for the same variant, the probability is calculated by dividing the individual model's weight by the sum of the weights of all models. (For example, if three models are used with weights 1, 1, and 2, then their combined weight would be 4 (1+1+2). The probability of each model being used would then be determined by dividing each weight by 4: 1/4, 1/4 and 2/4, or 25%, 25% and 50%, respectively.)

#### Rotation

If you need to create a piece of wood with three different orientations, all you need to do is specify the x and y properties. 

```yaml
model:
  path: "minecraft:block/custom/chinese_lantern"
  x: 90
  y: 180
  uvlock: false
```

> x: Rotation of the model on the x-axis in increments of 90 degrees.\
> y: Rotation of the model on the y-axis in increments of 90 degrees.\
> uvlock: Can be true or false (default). Locks the rotation of the texture of a block, if set to true. This way the texture does not rotate with the block when using the x and y-tags above.

## Multi-State Block

:::warning

The following content may become difficult to understand. I will explain it in as much detail as possible. Please make sure to read it **word by word**.

:::

The first step in creating a multi-state block is to define the type of state **property** for that block. In this example, I've set an `axis` property.

```yaml
blocks:
  default:palm_log:
    states: # state(s)
      properties:
        axis:             # Property name
          type: axis      # Data type
          default: y      # Default value
```

### Property 

The property name is almost arbitrary, but I recommend using lowercase letters. However, the plugin hardcodes certain names for special placement behaviors. For example, when a property is named `axis`, the plugin will automatically align its orientation during placement. This entire process is fully automated.

In the following example, since the property is named `custom_axis`, the plugin will NOT apply rotation during placement. No matter how you place it, the block will always use the state `custom_axis=y` when placed.

```yaml
custom_axis:
  type: axis
  default: y 
```

:::tip

You can find detailed information about property types and the plugin's hardcoded property names on [‚ÑπÔ∏è Properties](./states/properties.mdx).

### Appearance

In the second step, we need to configure the possible visual appearances for the custom block. For example, a log block requires three orientations, so we need to assign three vanilla states as its visual representations.

```yaml
blocks:
  default:palm_log:
    states:
      appearances:
        axisY:
          auto-state: "note_block"
          model:
            path: "minecraft:block/custom/stripped_palm_log"
            generation:
              parent: "minecraft:block/cube_column"
              textures:
                "end": "minecraft:block/custom/palm_log_top"
                "side": "minecraft:block/custom/palm_log"
        axisX:
          auto-state: "note_block"
          model:
            x: 90
            y: 90
            path: "minecraft:block/custom/stripped_palm_log_horizontal"
            generation:
              parent: "minecraft:block/cube_column_horizontal"
              textures:
                "end": "minecraft:block/custom/palm_log_top"
                "side": "minecraft:block/custom/palm_log"
        axisZ:
          auto-state: "note_block"
          model:
            x: 90
            path: "minecraft:block/custom/stripped_palm_log_horizontal"
            generation:
              parent: "minecraft:block/cube_column_horizontal"
              textures:
                "end": "minecraft:block/custom/palm_log_top"
                "side": "minecraft:block/custom/palm_log"
```

:::info

In the configuration above, `axisX`, `axisZ`, and `axisY` are arbitrary names. You can use any descriptive terms that clearly represent the visual states, as long as they are unique.

The configuration of `state` and `model(s)` follows the same rules as single-state blocks. If you're unsure about any details, please refer back to the relevant documentation.

:::

### Variant

Now for the final step: We need to combine all custom properties, list all possible combinations, and assign internal block IDs to each. If you're unfamiliar with **internal ID**, please review the relevant documentation.

For properties and their values, use `=` to connect them (e.g., `axis=y`). When multiple properties appear together, separate them with commas (e.g., `axis=y,age=7`).

```yaml
blocks:
  default:palm_log:
    states:
      variants:
        axis=x:
          appearance: axisX # refers to the appearance name we just defined in the "appearances"
        axis=y:
          appearance: axisY
        axis=z:
          appearance: axisZ
```

:::tip

To customize block settings for specific states, add configuration like this:

```yaml
variants:
  "distance=7,persistent=false,waterlogged=false":
    appearance: "default"
    settings:
      is-randomly-ticking: true
```

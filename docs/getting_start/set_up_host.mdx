Before adding your resource pack, you'll need to set up hosting for it. If you're just testing locally, simply run /ce reload all - it'll handle both packing and sending the resource pack for you!

:::info
All of below configs are set up in the `config.yml` file.

For services that require API keys, we recommend using CraftEngine's <Highlight color="#1877F2">**environment variables**</Highlight>. \
 **Sharing your config.yml without using env vars is riskyâ€”don't do it!**

:::tip

Want to check if your resource pack is fully hosted? Just run /ce reload all and see if it downloads properly!

:::

## None

When you need to use a third-party resource pack delivery system, you can set the host type to `none`.

```yaml
resource-pack:
  delivery:
    hosting:
      - type: "none"
```

## Self-hosting

## S3

:::caution

The rest are some less common hosting methods. If you need them, feel free to keep reading. But if you want to host resource packs yourself, just use the API method ResourcePackHosts.register() instead.
